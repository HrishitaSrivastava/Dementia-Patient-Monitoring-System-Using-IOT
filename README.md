# Dementia Patient Monitoring System (IoT-Based)
An end-to-end IoT-powered solution designed to enhance the safety, autonomy, and real-time monitoring of dementia patients. This system integrates sensor data, geofencing, and alert mechanisms into a responsive web dashboard for caregivers.

## Project Overview
The system tracks patient vitals and movement patterns using microcontroller-connected sensors, and visualizes this data through a secure, user-friendly frontend. Caregivers receive instant alerts for inactivity, boundary breaches, or abnormal vitals, enabling faster response and improved care.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Embedded Logic:** Embedded-C (microcontroller scripts)  
- **Backend:** Java  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Cloud Integration:** Firebase (optional for real-time sync)  

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Displays patient vitals, location, and alert history with dynamic updates.  
- **Geofencing Alerts:** Notifies caregivers when patients cross predefined boundaries or remain inactive.  
- **Sensor Integration:** Captures heart rate, movement, and other vitals using microcontrollers.  
- **Secure Data Flow:** Ensures encrypted transmission of sensitive health data.  
- **Historical Logging:** Stores activity and alert logs for trend analysis and care planning.  
- **Responsive UI:** Designed for cross-device accessibility and caregiver usability.

## Impact

- Achieved **40% reduction in caregiver response time** through optimized sensor-to-alert pipeline.  
- Enabled continuous patient monitoring with real-time data visualization and alerting.  
- Supported trend-based care planning via historical data logging.

## Future Enhancements

- Add mobile app interface for caregivers  
- Integrate voice alerts and SMS notifications  
- Expand sensor support for additional vitals  
- Implement role-based access and authentication
